::: {#exr-helloworld}
Write a helloworld quarto document. Submit the `qmd` file, the generated `pdf` file and the `data.csv` file stated below. I will grade it based on the `pdf` file, with `qmd` and `csv` as supplements.

In the document file, there should be 

- sections
- lists
- texts
- codes (computations)
- codes (read file and plot)

The data should be a csv file with name `data.csv` stored in the working folder. You need to manually create the `data.csv` file and your file should be able to work with `data.csv`. The data is as below. 

| x | y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 4 |
