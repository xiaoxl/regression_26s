**PLO 1: Statistical Methods Application**
An ability to apply appropriate statistical methods on data collected in business, industry, and government.

- 1.1 Identify data types and measurement scales
- 1.2 Select appropriate descriptive statistics and visualizations for given datasets
- 1.3 Perform hypothesis tests with correct interpretation of p-values and effect sizes in professional contexts 
- 1.4 Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for means, proportions, and differences between groups
- 1.5 Evaluate statistical assumptions and implement appropriate remedial measures when violations occur
- 1.6 Communicate statistical findings to non-technical stakeholders using appropriate terminology and visualizations

**PLO 2: Experimental Design and Analysis**
An ability to design and analyze experiments for standard situations.

- 2.1 Design completely randomized, randomized block, and factorial experiments with appropriate sample size calculations
- 2.2 Identify and control for confounding variables in experimental settings
- 2.3 Construct control charts (X-bar, R, p, c charts) and correctly interpret out-of-control signals
- 2.4 Calculate process capability indices (Cp, Cpk) and interpret their practical significance
- 2.5 Conduct analysis of variance (one-way, two-way) on experimental data with proper post-hoc comparisons
- 2.6 Apply design of experiments principles to quality improvement scenarios with measurable outcomes

**PLO 3: Statistical Software Implementation**
An ability to implement professional statistical software packages for statistical computing.

<!-- - 3.1 Execute data import, cleaning, and manipulation tasks in statistical software -->
- 3.1 Generate accurate statistical analyses including descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and regression models
