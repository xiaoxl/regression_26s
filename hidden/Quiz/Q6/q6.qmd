A power company wants to use daily high temperature, $x$, to model daily peak power load, $y$, during the summer months when demand is greatest.

Although the company expects peak load to increase as the temperature increases, the rate of increase in $E(y)$ might not remain constant as $x$ increases. For example, a 1-unit increase in high temperature from 100 °F to 101 °F might result in a larger increase in power demand than would a 1-unit increase from 80 °F to 81 °F. Therefore, the company postulates that the model for $E(y)$ will include a second-order (quadratic) term and, possibly, a third-order (cubic) term.

A random sample of 25 summer days is selected and both the peak load (measured in megawatts) and high temperature (in degrees) recorded for each day. The R output is attached.


::: {#exr-}
Fit the third-order model, $E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2+\beta_3x^3$, to the data. Is there evidence that the cubic term, $\beta_3x^3$, contributes information for the prediction of peak power load? Test at $\alpha = .05$.
:::

::: {#exr-ref}
Fit the third-order model, $E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2$, to the data.  Test the hypothesis that the power load increases at an increasing rate with temperature. In other words, is the curve concave upward? Use $\alpha = .05$.
:::


::: {#exr-}
Give the prediction equation for the second-order model, in @exr-ref. Are you satisfied with using this model to predict peak power loads?
