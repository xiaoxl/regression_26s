    "text": "1.2 Population vs Sample\n\nPopulation: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.\nSample: is a subset of the population\nStatistical Inference: The process of using data collected on a sample to draw conclusions about a population is called statistical inference.\n\nA population is described by parameters (e.g., \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\beta\\)). A sample produces statistics (e.g., \\(\\bar X\\), \\(s\\), \\(\\hat\\beta\\)), which vary across repeated samples. Statistical inference uses the sampling distribution of these statistics to draw conclusions about population parameters. This part will be revisited later in Chapter 3.\n\nExample 1.1 (gssr)  \n\n\nClick to expand.\n\nAccording to a previous national media report, the average age of U.S. adults who watch national TV news is 60 years. A data analyst hypothesizes that the average age of frequent TV-news watchers is greater than 60. To test this, she uses the General Social Survey (GSS), accessible via the gssr R package [1], to draw a sample of 500 respondents and record their ages.\n\nDescribe the population: All U.S. adults who watch TV news several times a week or more often, as defined by the GSS survey question on TV-news frequency.\nDescribe the sample: A random sample of 500 GSS respondents who meet the above criterion and have valid age data.\nSample size: \\(n = 500\\)\nDescribe the statistical inference: We want to determine whether the mean age of frequent TV-news watchers is greater than 60 based on the sampled data.",

We could use the following ways to display it. We first compute the frequency table of the variable Pop:\n\ntable(possum$Pop)\n## \n##   Vic other \n##    46    58\n\nor relative frequency table:\n\ntable(possum$Pop)/length(possum$Pop)\n## \n##       Vic     other \n## 0.4423077 0.5576923\n\nThen we could draw the barplot of this variable:\n\nbarplot(table(possum$Pop))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the pie plot:\n\npie(table(possum$Pop))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that table is handling the statistics, while barplot and pie draw on top of the result from table.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Quantitative (numerical) data\nFor quantitative data, we would like to see the histogram, as well as computing some statistics: min, max, quartiles, median and mean.\n\nHistogram is an approximation of the distribution. In other words, we split the range into small segments (called bins), and count the frequency or relative frequency of data falling into these bins.\nBox plot consists of a box, two lines and possibly some points:\n\nThe box in the box plot extends from the lower quartile to the upper quartile. The difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile is called the inter-quartile range (IQR).\nThe lines, known as whiskers, extend to one and a half times the interquartile range, but they stop at the most extreme data points that fall within this range.\nThe points, considered as outliers, are those which are not covered by the box and the lines.\n\n\nHistograms and boxplots help check normality and outliers before fitting regression. These summaries approximate the underlying distribution of the variable. In regression, we later apply similar tools to the residuals to check model assumptions.\n\nExample 1.4 (possum)  \n\n\nClick to expand.\n\nWe still consider the possum dataset. We could use summary to compute the major statistics.\n\nlibrary(DAAG)\ndata(possum)\nsummary(possum)\n##       case             site          Pop     sex         age       \n##  Min.   :  1.00   Min.   :1.000   Vic  :46   f:43   Min.   :1.000  \n##  1st Qu.: 26.75   1st Qu.:1.000   other:58   m:61   1st Qu.:2.250  \n##  Median : 52.50   Median :3.000                     Median :3.000  \n##  Mean   : 52.50   Mean   :3.625                     Mean   :3.833  \n##  3rd Qu.: 78.25   3rd Qu.:6.000                     3rd Qu.:5.000  \n##  Max.   :104.00   Max.   :7.000                     Max.   :9.000  \n##                                                     NA's   :2      \n##     hdlngth           skullw         totlngth         taill      \n##  Min.   : 82.50   Min.   :50.00   Min.   :75.00   Min.   :32.00  \n##  1st Qu.: 90.67   1st Qu.:54.98   1st Qu.:84.00   1st Qu.:35.88  \n##  Median : 92.80   Median :56.35   Median :88.00   Median :37.00  \n##  Mean   : 92.60   Mean   :56.88   Mean   :87.09   Mean   :37.01  \n##  3rd Qu.: 94.72   3rd Qu.:58.10   3rd Qu.:90.00   3rd Qu.:38.00  \n##  Max.   :103.10   Max.   :68.60   Max.   :96.50   Max.   :43.00  \n##                                                                  \n##     footlgth        earconch          eye            chest          belly      \n##  Min.   :60.30   Min.   :40.30   Min.   :12.80   Min.   :22.0   Min.   :25.00  \n##  1st Qu.:64.60   1st Qu.:44.80   1st Qu.:14.40   1st Qu.:25.5   1st Qu.:31.00  \n##  Median :68.00   Median :46.80   Median :14.90   Median :27.0   Median :32.50  \n##  Mean   :68.46   Mean   :48.13   Mean   :15.05   Mean   :27.0   Mean   :32.59  \n##  3rd Qu.:72.50   3rd Qu.:52.00   3rd Qu.:15.72   3rd Qu.:28.0   3rd Qu.:34.12  \n##  Max.   :77.90   Max.   :56.20   Max.   :17.80   Max.   :32.0   Max.   :40.00  \n##  NA's   :1\n\nThe variable hdlngth (head length) is quantitative.

Scatterplots help us assess linearity, detect outliers, and decide whether transformation is needed.\n\nExample 1.5 (possum)  \n\n\nClick to expand.\n\nWhen both variables are numerical and continuous:\n\nplot(possum$hdlngth, possum$skullw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen one variable is categorical:\n\nplot(as.factor(possum$Pop), possum$skullw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in this case, the categorical data has to be a factor. And once it is cast into a factor, the plot is multiple box plots for each category. This type of grouped boxplot corresponds to comparing group means and is directly related to one-way ANOVA and regression with dummy variables. It will be discussed in later sections.\nWe can see pair plots for each pair of variables. Pair plots are very important because they help reveal relationships among predictors. Note that before creating the plot, we have to cast pop and sex into factors.\n\npossum$Pop &lt;- as.factor(possum$Pop)\npossum$sex &lt;- as.factor(possum$sex)\npairs(possum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Healy, K.

The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is assumed to be the default case, and they want to make sure that once the signal is captured, the effect happens. In this case it is ok to miss some events that happens without the signal. In other words, people prioritize not making a false claim than missing an opportunity.\nWe could balance Type I and Type II errors by controlling \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nReduing \\(\\alpha\\) will make the test less likely to make Type I errors but increase the likelihood of Type II errors.\nIncreasing sample size reduces probability of making both types of errors, which can improve the test’s reliability.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 t-test\nA t-test is used to test a hypothesis about a population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small or moderate. In our case, we consider the standard one-sample t-test: given a set of random observations, we want to determine whether the population mean of the underlying random variable is equal to 0 or not.\nAssume that the given values are \\(\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}\\), and the underlying random variable is \\(X\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). The hypotheses are\n\n\\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu=0\\).\n\\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu\\neq0\\).\n\nThe values can be treated as realizations of i.i.d random variables \\(X_i\\)’s. We have the following statistics:\n\nSample mean: \\(\\bar{X}=\\frac1n\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\).\nSample standard deviation: \\(s=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar X)^2}\\)\nSample size: \\(n\\).\n\nThese statistics have sampling distributions that can be described exactly under the normality assumption.\nBased on the discussion in Section 2.4.2, we have that\n\n\\(Z=\\frac{\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt n}\\sim N(0,1)\\)\n\\(U=\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}\\)\n\\(Z\\) and \\(U\\) are independent, and the degree of freedom of \\(U\\) is \\(\\nu = n-1\\),\n\\(t=\\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{U/(n-1)}}\\sim t_{n-1}\\).\n\nSince the alternative hypothesis is \\(\\mu\\neq0\\), we need to consider both tails, corresponding to \\(\\mu&gt;0\\) and \\(\\mu&lt;0\\). Therefore the boundary of the rejection region is chosen so that each tail has probability \\(\\alpha/2\\). In other words, the critical value \\(t_{1-\\alpha/2,n-1}\\) satisfies, under \\(H_0\\), \\[\n\\Pr(|t|&gt;t_{1-\\alpha/2,n-1})=\\alpha.\n\\] This critical value \\(t_{1-\\alpha/2,n-1}\\) is usually found from a t-distribution table or via the inverse c.d.f. of the t-distribution.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Mendenhall, W. and Sincich, T.

    "text": "5.2 Estimation\n\n\n5.2.1 OLS estimators\nThe standard approach is known as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. In this method, model parameters are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed responses and the values predicted by the model. From an optimization perspective, OLS minimizes a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the data and the fitted model.\nHere are more details.\nConsider the linear regression model \\[\ny_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i+\\varepsilon_i,\\quad i=1,\\ldots, n.\n\\]\nIn order to find the best parameters, we need to minimize the sum of squared errors \\[\nL(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\varepsilon_i^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2.\n\\] Since this loss can be treated as a function of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), to minimize it, we could consider the critical point, which is\n\\[\n\\pdv{L}{\\beta_0}=0,\\quad \\pdv{L}{\\beta_1}=0.\n\\] In other words, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\pdv{L}{\\beta_0}&=\\sum_{i=1}^n2(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)(-1)=-2\\qty(\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i-n\\beta_0-\\beta_1(\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i))=-2n(\\bar y-\\beta_0-\\beta_1\\bar x)=0,\\\\\n\\pdv{L}{\\beta_1}&=\\sum_{i=1}^n2(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)(-x_i).\n\\end{split}\n\\] The first equation gives us \\(\\beta_0=\\bar y-\\beta_1\\bar x\\). Then the second equation is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\pdv{L}{\\beta_1}&=\\sum_{i=1}^n2(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)(-x_i)=-2\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar y+\\beta_1\\bar x-\\beta_1x_i)(x_i)\\\\\n&=-2\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar y-\\beta_1(x_i-\\bar x))(x_i)=-2\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar y-\\beta_1(x_i-\\bar x))(x_i-\\bar x)\\\\\n&=-2\\qty(\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar y)(x_i-\\bar x)-\\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar x)(x_i-\\bar x))\\\\\n&=-2\\qty(SS_{xy}-\\beta_1SS_{xx})=0.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTherefore, the solution to the equations, which is the best parameters that minimize the sum of square errors, is\n\nTheorem 5.1 \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_1=\\frac{SS_{xy}}{SS_{xx}},\\quad \\hat{\\beta}_0=\\bar{y}-\\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n5.2.2 MLE estimators\nSince we assume \\(\\varepsilon_i\\sim \\mathcal N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) i.i.d, we could actually compute the likelihood function explicitly. Recall that \\(y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i+\\varepsilon_i\\), then \\[\n\\begin{split}\np(y_i\\mid x_i,\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}\\exp\\qty(-\\frac{(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}).\n\\end{split}\n\\] Take all data into consideration. Let \\(\\mathbf x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\). Assuming that all \\(\\varepsilon_i\\)’s are independent, then the likelihood function is \\[\nL(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma^2\\mid \\mathbf x, \\mathbf y)=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\qty(-\\frac{(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}).\n\\] We could take negative log to make it simpler \\[\n\\operatorname{nll}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma^2\\mid \\mathbf x, \\mathbf y)=\\frac n2\\ln\\qty(2\\pi\\sigma^2)+\\frac1{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2.\n\\] This derived loss function is called the negative log-likelihood (NLL). Maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing \\(\\operatorname{nll}\\).\nFor fixed \\(\\sigma^2\\), minimizing \\(\\operatorname{nll}\\) over \\((\\beta_0,\\beta_1)\\) is equivalent to minimizing \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2\\), so the MLE of \\((\\beta_0,\\beta_1)\\) is the same as the OLS estimator.\nTo estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\), treat \\(\\sigma^2\\) as a variable and differentiate: \\[\n\\pdv{\\operatorname{nll}}{\\sigma^2}=\\frac{n}2\\frac1{\\sigma^2}-\\frac12\\frac{1}{(\\sigma^2)^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x_i)^2=0.\n\\] Setting this derivative to zero yields\n\nTheorem 5.2 \\[\n\\hat\\sigma_{MLE}^2=\\frac1n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat\\beta_0-\\hat\\beta_1x_i)^2=\\frac{SSE}{n}.\n\\]\n\nSimilar to the sample variance scenario, the MLE estimator for variance is biased. The unbiased estimator of the error variance is the sample variance of the residuals. \\[\ns^2=\\frac{SSE}{n-2}.\n\\]\n\n\n5.2.3 Properties of these estimators\n\nTheorem 5.3 \\[\n\\operatorname{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)=\\beta_0, \\quad \\operatorname{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)=\\beta_1,\\quad \\operatorname{E}(s^2)=\\sigma^2.\n\\]\n\n\nClick for proof.\n\nThe key point is to treat all \\(x_i\\)’s as constants, and \\(y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i+\\varepsilon_i\\) is a random variable due to \\(\\varepsilon_i\\). Note that \\(\\operatorname{E}(y_i)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i\\) and \\(\\operatorname{E}(\\bar y)=\\frac1n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\operatorname{E}(y_i)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1\\bar x\\). \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\operatorname{E}(SS_{xy})&=\\operatorname{E}\\qty(\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar x)(y_i-\\bar y))\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar x)(\\operatorname{E}(y_i)-\\operatorname{E}(\\bar y))\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar x)(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i-\\beta_0-\\beta_1\\bar x)\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar x)\\beta_1(x_i-\\bar x)\\\\\n&=\\beta_1SS_{xx}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\operatorname{E}(\\hat\\beta_1)=\\operatorname{E}\\qty(\\frac{SS_{xy}}{SS_{xx}})=\\beta_1.\n\\] We now show that \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\beta_0\\). Recall that \\[\n\\hat\\beta_0 = \\bar y - \\hat\\beta_1 \\bar x.\n\\] Taking expectations and using linearity of expectation, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{E}(\\hat\\beta_0)\n&= \\operatorname{E}(\\bar y) - \\bar x\\,\\operatorname{E}(\\hat\\beta_1) \\\\\n&= (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\bar x) - \\bar x\\,\\beta_1 \\\\\n&= \\beta_0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Therefore, \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\beta_0\\).\nFor \\(s^2\\), it requires more knowledge from \\(\\chi^22\\) distribution.\n\n\\(\\varepsilon_i\\sim \\mathcal N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) i.i.d, and \\(x_i\\)’s are all constants.\n\\(e_i=y_i-\\hat y_i=\\varepsilon_i-(\\hat\\beta_0-\\beta_0)+(\\hat\\beta_1-\\beta_1)x_i\\). Note that \\(\\hat\\beta_0-\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1-\\beta_1\\) are functions of all \\(\\varepsilon_i\\)’s so each residual depends on the entire error vector.\nSince \\(SSE=\\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2\\), by Theorem 2.3, one can show that \\(\\frac{SSE}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi_{n-2}^2\\). The loss of 2 degrees of freedom comes from estimating \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nTherefore \\(\\operatorname{E}\\qty(\\frac{SSE}{\\sigma^2})=n-2\\).\nTherefore \\(\\operatorname{E}(s^2)=\\frac1{n-2}\\operatorname{E}(SSE)=\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 5.4 \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{SS_{xx}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)=\\qty(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\bar x^2}{nSS_{xx}})\\sigma^2, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(s^2)=\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-2}.\n\\]\n\n\nClick for proof.\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)=\\frac{1}{SS_{xx}^2}\\operatorname{Var}(SS_{xy})=\\frac{1}{SS_{xx}^2}\\operatorname{Var}\\qty[\\sum x_i(y_i-\\bar{y})]=\\frac{1}{SS_{xx}^2}SS_{xx}\\sigma^2=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{SS_{xx}}.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(\\bar y ,\\hat\\beta_1)=0\\), we have \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)&=\\operatorname{Var}\\qty(\\bar y-\\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar x)=\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar y)+\\bar{x}^2\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}+\\bar x^2\\frac{\\sigma^2}{nSS_{xx}}=\\qty(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\bar x^2}{nSS_{xx}})\\sigma^2.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\frac{SSE}{\\sigma^2}\\sim\\chi^2_{n-2}\\), \\(\\var(\\frac{SSE}{\\sigma^2})=2(n-2)\\). Therefore \\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(s^2)=\\operatorname{Var}(\\frac{SSE}{n-2})=\\frac1{(n-2)^2}\\operatorname{Var}(SSE)=\\frac1{(n-2)^2}(\\sigma^2)^22(n-2)=\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-2}.\n\\]\n\n\nNote that these variance formulas involve \\(\\sigma^2\\). They come from a theoretical (population) analysis, so they can depend on unknown parameters. If we want numerical estimates of these variances from data, we must replace the unknown quantities with estimators and rebuild the variance calculations accordingly (typically by plugging in \\(s^2\\) for \\(\\sigma^2\\), and using the sample versions of any other unknown terms).",

This suggests that \\(r\\) is the standarized slope, while \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) dependes on the units of measurement of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nThis \\(r\\) and the previous \\(r^2\\) is related. \\[\n\\abs{r}=\\frac{SS_{xy}}{\\sqrt{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{xy}^2}{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{SSR}{SST}}=\\sqrt{r^2}.\n\\] This is the reason we choose these notations. Note that I ignore the sign of \\(r\\) in this computation. When using \\(\\sqrt{r^2}\\) to compute \\(r\\), we have to manually choose the sign for \\(r\\) based on other indicators.\nSince \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) essentially describe the same linear relationship, we can also use \\(r\\) to perform the hypothesis test.

    "text": "7.1 The Boston Housing Dataset\nThe Boston housing dataset originates from a hedonic price analysis of 506 census tracts in the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area conducted by Harrison and Rubinfeld to estimate households’ willingness to pay for improvements in air quality, particularly reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations [1]. The data were assembled primarily from 1970 U.S. Census housing tabulations combined with modeled environmental pollution measures. Since its original publication, the dataset has been widely disseminated as the Boston dataset in econometrics, statistics, and machine learning, where it is commonly used to illustrate and evaluate linear regression methods. It was notably employed by Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch in Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity (pp. 244–261) [2] to demonstrate diagnostic techniques for detecting influential observations and multicollinearity, and has subsequently appeared in numerous methodological studies, including Quinlan’s work on combining instance-based and model-based learning [3].\nIn R, the MASS library contains Boston data set, which has 506 rows and 14 columns. The dataset records medv (median house value) and 13 predictors for 506 neighborhoods around Boston.",

    "text": "7.3 Simple Linear Regression\nWe will seek to predict medv using 13 predictors such as rm (average number of rooms per house), age (proportion of the owner-occupied units built prior to 1940), or lstat (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).\n\n7.3.1 Find a strongest linear correlation\nIn general there has to be a more complicated analysis about choosing the best variable. In this case in order to demonstrate the idea, we will only use the most correlted numerical variable.\nHere, we use corrlation matrix to find the independent variable which has the strongest linear correlation to the dependent variable.\nWe first find out the numeric columns.\n\nBoston_num &lt;- Boston[, sapply(Boston, is.numeric)] \n\nThen we compute the corrlation matrix. We would like to find the column that is most correlated to medv. We find that lstat and medv has the strongest linear correlation.\n\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(Boston_num)\nround(cor_matrix, 2)\n##          crim    zn indus  chas   nox    rm   age   dis   rad   tax ptratio\n## crim     1.00 -0.20  0.41 -0.06  0.42 -0.22  0.35 -0.38  0.63  0.58    0.29\n## zn      -0.20  1.00 -0.53 -0.04 -0.52  0.31 -0.57  0.66 -0.31 -0.31   -0.39\n## indus    0.41 -0.53  1.00  0.06  0.76 -0.39  0.64 -0.71  0.60  0.72    0.38\n## chas    -0.06 -0.04  0.06  1.00  0.09  0.09  0.09 -0.10 -0.01 -0.04   -0.12\n## nox      0.42 -0.52  0.76  0.09  1.00 -0.30  0.73 -0.77  0.61  0.67    0.19\n## rm      -0.22  0.31 -0.39  0.09 -0.30  1.00 -0.24  0.21 -0.21 -0.29   -0.36\n## age      0.35 -0.57  0.64  0.09  0.73 -0.24  1.00 -0.75  0.46  0.51    0.26\n## dis     -0.38  0.66 -0.71 -0.10 -0.77  0.21 -0.75  1.00 -0.49 -0.53   -0.23\n## rad      0.63 -0.31  0.60 -0.01  0.61 -0.21  0.46 -0.49  1.00  0.91    0.46\n## tax      0.58 -0.31  0.72 -0.04  0.67 -0.29  0.51 -0.53  0.91  1.00    0.46\n## ptratio  0.29 -0.39  0.38 -0.12  0.19 -0.36  0.26 -0.23  0.46  0.46    1.00\n## black   -0.39  0.18 -0.36  0.05 -0.38  0.13 -0.27  0.29 -0.44 -0.44   -0.18\n## lstat    0.46 -0.41  0.60 -0.05  0.59 -0.61  0.60 -0.50  0.49  0.54    0.37\n## medv    -0.39  0.36 -0.48  0.18 -0.43  0.70 -0.38  0.25 -0.38 -0.47   -0.51\n##         black lstat  medv\n## crim    -0.39  0.46 -0.39\n## zn       0.18 -0.41  0.36\n## indus   -0.36  0.60 -0.48\n## chas     0.05 -0.05  0.18\n## nox     -0.38  0.59 -0.43\n## rm       0.13 -0.61  0.70\n## age     -0.27  0.60 -0.38\n## dis      0.29 -0.50  0.25\n## rad     -0.44  0.49 -0.38\n## tax     -0.44  0.54 -0.47\n## ptratio -0.18  0.37 -0.51\n## black    1.00 -0.37  0.33\n## lstat   -0.37  1.00 -0.74\n## medv     0.33 -0.74  1.00\n\nThe matrix can be visualized. lstat is also the most obvious choice from the plot.\n\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nggcorrplot(cor_matrix, hc.order = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next step, we will explore the linear relationship between the two variables. That is, \\(y\\)=medv, \\(x\\)=lstat.\n\nplot(lstat, medv)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data appears to demostrate a straight-line relationshiop. As the percentage of lower status of the population (lstat) increase, the median home value decrease, which fits with common sense. The scatterplot shows curvilinear relation, which suggests a curivilinear model might be a better fit. In this chapter, we fit the straight-line model using lm.\nHere is a quick glance about how lm works.\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(medv ~ lstat, data = Boston)\nmodel\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = medv ~ lstat, data = Boston)\n## \n## Coefficients:\n## (Intercept)        lstat  \n##       34.55        -0.95\ncoef(model)\n## (Intercept)       lstat \n##  34.5538409  -0.9500494\n\nThe estimated regression equation by using least squares method is \\(\\hat{y}\\)=34.5538409\\(+\\)(-0.9500494)\\(x\\).\n\n\n7.3.2 Test of model utility\nWe would like to see the output of the model.\n\nanova_alt(model)\n## Analysis of Variance Table\n## \n##         Df    SS      MS      F          P\n## Source   1 23244 23243.9 601.62 5.0811e-88\n## Error  504 19472    38.6                  \n## Total  505 42716\nsummary(model)\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = medv ~ lstat, data = Boston)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -15.168  -3.990  -1.318   2.034  24.500 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##             Estimate Std.

For simple linear regression, the result would be the same as the correlation hypothesis test above. We will conclude percentage of lower status (lstat) is a significant predictor to the median house price (medv).\nCI for \\(\\beta_1\\): The confidence interval for slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is (-1.0261482, -0.8739505). We are 95% confident that the mean median home price decreases around 0.874 to 1.026 thousands of dollors per additional percent increase in low-status of the population.\nsd for \\(\\beta_1\\): The estimated standard deviation of \\(\\varepsilon\\) is \\(s\\)=6.2157604, which implies that most of the observed median home price will fall within in approximately \\(2s\\)=12.4 thousands of dollars of their respective predicted values when using the least squares line.\n\\(R^2\\): The coefficient of determination is 0.544. This value implies that about 54% of the sample variation in median home price is explained by the low-status percent and the median home price. However, as we note that \\(R^2\\) is not very high, we need to modify our model in the future.\nPrediction: With relatively small \\(2s\\), significant linear relationship between lstat and medv, we could get confidence interval and prediction interval as follows.\n\n\nplot(lstat, medv)\n\nnewx &lt;- data.frame(lstat = seq(min(lstat), max(lstat), by = 0.1))\npred.int &lt;- predict(model, newx, interval = \"prediction\")\nconf.int &lt;- predict(model, newx, interval = \"confidence\")\n\nlines(newx$lstat, pred.int[, \"fit\"])\n\nlines(newx$lstat, pred.int[, \"lwr\"], col = \"red\")\nlines(newx$lstat, pred.int[, \"upr\"], col = \"red\")\n\nlines(newx$lstat, conf.int[, \"lwr\"], col = \"blue\")\nlines(newx$lstat, conf.int[, \"upr\"], col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Residual Analysis\nThe detailed residual analysis will be covered in the future. Here we only show the very basic analysis, that is the plot of the residual vs the predictor variable lstat.\n\nres &lt;- resid(model)\nplot(lstat, res)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could find that there is a clear u-shape in the residual plot. And the variance shows non-constant variance issue, as the size of the residuals decreases as the value of lstat increase. This residual plot indicates that a multiplicative model may be appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air.
