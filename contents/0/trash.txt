The distribution of a statistic is called the sampling distribution.

Key Points:
A statistic is a numerical value calculated from a sample (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion, or sample variance).
The sampling distribution describes the probability distribution of that statistic across all possible samples of a given size from the population.
Example:
If you repeatedly draw samples of size 
𝑛
n from a population and calculate the sample mean (
𝑥
ˉ
x
ˉ
 ) for each sample, the distribution of these sample means is the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
Similarly, if you calculate a proportion or variance for each sample, their distributions across samples are the sampling distributions of the sample proportion or sample variance, respectively.
The concept of a sampling distribution is foundational in inferential statistics, as it underpins methods like hypothesis testing and the construction of confidence intervals.
