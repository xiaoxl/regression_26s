## `possum` {#sec-app_possum}
The dataset `possum` originates from the `DAAG` package, created to support the book *Data Analysis and Graphics Using R* @DAAG-package. The underlying data were collected in @Lindenmayer1995, with the scientific aim of quantifying morphological variation among geographically distinct populations of the mountain brushtail possum. The dataset `possum` contains nine morphometric measurements on each of 104 possums trapped across seven Australian sites spanning southern Victoria to central Queensland. Additional details and variable descriptions are available in the official [DAAG package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DAAG/refman/DAAG.html#possum).

The package can be installed by the following code.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("DAAG")
```

The dataset can be loaded by the following code.
```{r}
#| warning: false
library(DAAG)
data(possum)
head(possum)
```
